- Optimize and rewrite my Minecraft mods.
- Contribute to the Beat Saber Quest modding community.

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Can I use your mods in my modpack?</summary>
 
  You have full permission to include my mods in modpacks ***with credit given either in the changelog or description of the modpack*** on curseforge/modrinth. Credits include a link to the mod's curseforge or modrinth page. Exceptions can be granted by DMing me on discord.

<details>
  <summary>Why are your Minecraft mods ARR?</summary>
 
  I do not find the open source system useful for Minecraft modding - however, I intend that you can be able look at my code, learn from it, and validate it's legitimacy, freely. Contributions are accepted, however you must accept that all code you pull request belongs to me once merged, I will give credit though.
            
  If this permission is abused, I will be fully close sourcing my Minecraft Mod repos.
            
  Beat Saber mods for Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest 2 Pro remain open source licensed due to their nature of being difficult to create and the small modding community surrounding it.
